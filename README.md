# hw-5-planner
A simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day.
<br><br>
### __Daily Planner__
Set up a planner that will allow the user to pick a time, add in content and save. The calendar will let you know the past, present and future times which will be differentiated by color. 
<br><br>
Even when the user leaves the page, their saved content in each calendar row will remain saved inside the interface with the help of local storage. 
<br><br>

### __Goals and Impressions__

The goal is to create a working calendar with the following features:

* Create an attractive User Interface
* Allow users to type in and save content
* Store content in local storage
* Pull content from local storage and back into interface when refresh or close of browser occurs

<br>
This was a challenging experience, but the outcome was really awesome, and I would love to explore ways to make a more robust app.
